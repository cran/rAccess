Description: Provides a flexible framework for implementing hierarchical access 
    control in 'shiny' applications. Features include user permission management 
    through a two-tier system of access panels and units, pluggable 'shiny' 
    module for administrative interfaces, and support for multiple storage 
    backends (local, 'AWS S3', 'Posit Connect'). The system enables fine-grained
    control over application features, with built-in audit trails and user 
    management capabilities. Integrates seamlessly with 'Posit Connect's 
    authentication system.
